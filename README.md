# Tidal Configuration GUI

This is a simple GUI for configuring the SuperCollider local server and SuperDirt for use with TidalCycles.
It is by no means fancy; it's my first time making a GUI or working with SuperCollider in this way after all.
The goal of this project is to make it easier for new users to get started with TidalCycles.

### Planned Features

- Add a small help menu
- Add ability to add file paths to load samples
- Ability to change buffers and other parameters
