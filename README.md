# Server Configuration GUI

This is a simple GUI for configuring the SuperCollider local server and SuperDirt for use with TidalCycles. The goal of this project is to make it easier for new users to get started with TidalCycles and SuperCollider.

## Installation

Unzip the folder and evaluate `Quarks.install("path/to/directory")`

## Bugs

This is a new project which hasn't been thouroughly tested. Open [issues](https://github.com/intothebeans/SC-ServerConfigGUI/issues) on GitHub, and I'll try to fix them ASAP.

Saving settings doesn't restore the drop down menus to the correct values. This is a known issue, and SuperCollider doesn't seem to have an easy way to do this.
